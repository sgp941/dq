    "# Winning Jeopardy\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture. This project will attempt to find patterns in the questions that are asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with a dataset of 20,000 Jeopardy questions, of which the full dataset is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/). The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show Number** -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- **Air Date** -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- **Round** -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- **Category** -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- **Value** -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- **Question** -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- **Answer** -- the text of the answer."
