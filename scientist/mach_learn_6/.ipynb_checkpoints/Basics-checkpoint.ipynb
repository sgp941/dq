    "# Credit Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, and Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data to assign an interest rate to the borrower. A higher interest rate means that the borrower is riskier and more unlikely to pay back the loan, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time, however, and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit) which contains information on the different column names towards the bottom of the page. The LoanStats sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the RejectStats describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data on approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approved loans datasets contain information on current loans, completed loans, and defaulted loans. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not. "

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, even through we're not using accuracy as an error metric, the classifier is, and it isn't accounting for the imbalance in the classes. There are a few ways to get a classifier to correct for imbalanced classes. The two main ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use oversampling and undersampling to ensure that the classifier gets input that has a balanced number of each class.\n",
    "2. Tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look into oversampling and undersampling first. They involve taking a sample that contains equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0, and where loan_status is 1. This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this technique is that since it has to preserve an equal ratio, you have to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throw out many rows of data. If we wanted equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0 and where loan_status is 1, one way we could do that is to delete rows where loan_status is 1.\n",

    "- Generate fake data. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to generate new rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of these techniques are especially easy. The second method we mentioned earlier, telling the classifier to penalize certain rows more, is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn. We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process"
